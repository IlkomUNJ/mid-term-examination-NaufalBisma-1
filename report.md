# Analysis of Ideal Window Size (Objective 1)
2.1. Size Exploration
The exploration focused on common window sizes used for detecting graphical primitives:$3 \times 3$ (Selected): This size is computationally efficient and is sufficient to capture the fundamental features of the line, including single-pixel edges and dense centers.$5 \times 5$: While capable of capturing thicker lines, it generates a significantly larger number of non-empty patterns, making the analysis for Milestone 1 cumbersome.

2.2. Ideal Finding
Ideal Window Size: $3 \times 3$Despite the 4-pixel line thickness, the $3 \times 3$ window is chosen because:It is the most efficient size for identifying basic features and filtering patterns for the detector.It can accurately distinguish between different parts of the segment (center vs. edge) for effective pattern matching.

# Suitable Window Patterns (Objective 2)
Analysis was performed on the dumped non-empty $3 \times 3$ windows (Milestone 1 output) generated by sliding the window across the 4-pixel red lines. These patterns form the core of the filter for the automated detector.


3.1. Core Patterns (Most Frequent)These patterns represent the main body of the thick line and are essential for the primary segment detection filter:


3.2. Primitive Patterns (Endpoints and Thin Lines)
These patterns are necessary to ensure the detector also catches line endpoints, thin segments, and diagonal sections:
